The study of computer memory from a low level to database servers typically falls under the broad field of **computer architecture** and **systems design**, with several subdomains involved:

1. **Computer Architecture**: This area focuses on the design, structure, and functioning of computer systems. It includes the study of low-level memory structures like registers, cache memory, main memory (RAM), and how the CPU interacts with these components.
    
2. **Operating Systems (OS)**: This area covers how memory management is handled by the operating system, including virtual memory, memory paging, segmentation, and efficient allocation of memory resources to applications and processes.
    
3. **Data Structures and Algorithms**: While not directly related to physical memory hardware, the study of algorithms often involves understanding how data is stored and accessed in memory, particularly in low-level languages like C or assembly.
    
4. **Database Systems**: This area focuses on how databases manage data storage and memory utilization, including techniques like indexing, caching, and memory buffers. It also involves studying the underlying database management system (DBMS) memory models, query optimization, and storage engines (e.g., B-trees, LSM-trees).
    
5. **Distributed Systems**: In the context of databases, the study of distributed systems includes understanding how memory and data are managed across multiple servers or nodes, including concepts like replication, consistency, and memory sharing between nodes.
    
6. **Memory Management**: This is a more specialized topic that looks at the allocation, deallocation, and optimization of memory at both the hardware and software levels, from low-level memory management (e.g., heap management, garbage collection) to higher-level memory management in DBMS.
    

### Specific Fields and Keywords:

- **Memory Hierarchy**: Refers to the structure of various types of memory in a computer system, from registers and cache to RAM and disk storage.
- **Database Storage Engines**: Study of how databases store data on disk and in memory (e.g., InnoDB, SQLite, etc.).
- **Caching**: Techniques to optimize memory usage and speed up data retrieval by storing frequently accessed data in faster storage (often in-memory).
- **Virtual Memory and Paging**: Concepts that allow systems to use disk storage as "virtual" RAM when physical memory is exhausted.
- **Database Buffer Pools**: Memory areas in DBMSs where data pages are stored temporarily for efficient retrieval.
