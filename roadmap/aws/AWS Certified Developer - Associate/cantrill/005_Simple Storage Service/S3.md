# Bucket Policy
- is a Resource policy
	- alternate policy set at IAM side (identity policy).
	- Can allow external (anonymous/cross-account) identities to access resource.
	- *Who* can address *what*
		- Who: identity, conditional IP addresses, auth protocol
- **Block Public Access Setting**
	- Failsafe for restricting public (non-AWS) access.
		- Choose apply to future permissions or overwrite existing permissions also.
- **Object Versioning**
	- Disabled by default. Once enabled, cannot be disabled (only suspend).
	- Capacity eating.
	- Secure Enable and Delete: need MFA
	- Delete marker is added to the object history on `DELETE`. i.e to undo `DELETE`, delete the delete marker.
# Static Website Hosting
- Can map domain to bucket name using Route53.
# Cost
- S3 Standard
	- Storage: per GB per month
	- Per 1000 API calls
	- IN-DATA and INTRA is free, OUT-DATA is chargeable.

# Performance Optimization
`PUT` uploads
- Use S3 Multipart
- Use S3 Accelerated Transfer for long distance.
	- Direct hops: ISP -> Edge Location -> S3

# Encryption Keys

By default, S3 uses its own keys. Can delegate key generation and operations to [KMS](Fundamentals#Key Management Service (KMS)). KMS incurs cost and also has usage frequency limit, alternative is to use bucket keys to save cost. Bucket keys generate short-lived keys from KMS and "cache" it to use.


# Storage Classes of Objects

### S3 Standard
- For frequent use, replicated to 3 AZ
### S3 Standard (Infrequent Access)
- Same as Standard, but for infrequent read of long-lived data.
- Additional cost for retrieval on top of OUT-DATA cost.
- Cost minimum of 30 days.
### S3 Standard (One Zone - Infrequent Data)
- NO REPLICAS, for non-critical data.
- Can be faster than Standard. Cheaper too.
### Glacier - Instant
- Cost minimum of 90 days.
- Cheap storage, but retrieval has cost.
### Glacier - Flexible
- Cheaper then Instant.
- Data is "freezed", reads require a retrieval process to Standard-IA
- Latency of Retrieval modes:
	- Expedited: 1-5 minutes
	- Standard:  3-5 hours
	- Bulk:  5-12 hours
### Glacier - Deep Archive
- Similar to Flexible.
- Secondary, long-term archive data.
- Cost minimum of 180 days, 40Kb minimum size.

# Replication
- For resilience and latency reduction.
- Whole bucket or subset.
- Non-retroactive.
- Source to Destination.
	- Versioning MUST be enabled on both, replication is one-way by default.
	- Source MUST NOT be Glacier*
	- Cross-account replication requires bucket policy on destination side.
	- Can configure different storage class for replicated objects.
	- Can configure ownership of replicated object to be assumed by destination's account.

# Pre-signed URLs
- encoded with identity of sign requestor, with expiry date.
- on use, AWS checks if identity have permissions currently.

# Reading CSV / JSON objects.
- SQL-like commands for AWS-side filtering.
