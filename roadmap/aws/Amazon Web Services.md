First exam, no prior AWS experience, new grad.

1 - Stephan Maarek's Slides PDF (His videos are too long) (nice explaining style) (943 pages)

2 - Stephan Maarek's 6 practice exams(20%, 35%, 47%, 45%, 71%, 75%) Neal Davis's 6 practice exams(bit outdated), Tutorial Dojo's 6 practice exams(highly recommend) (62%, 78%, 87%, 94%, 78%, 82%)

3 - Flashcards from this guy here:Â [https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/1ha2nkx/passed_3_associate_exams_in_3_weeks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/comments/1ha2nkx/passed_3_associate_exams_in_3_weeks/)

(Donate him if you can)

4 - Used ChatGPT to explain differences between services and ask questions (KMS v. SSM Parameter Store, DynamoDB API calls, LSI v GSI, CloudFront questions, Lambda Invocations from DynamoDB, S3, etc.)

5 - Exam Cram PDF from Neal Davis's Udemy Course (79 pages)

Can't recommend Tutorial Dojo's practice exams enough. Read every single questions answer, read when you do it correct, read when you do it incorrect. It's harder than actual exam but pays it off immensely.
